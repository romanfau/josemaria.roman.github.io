                  hspace="5" vspace="0" align="right"></a>I was born in
              Zamora (Spain), and I lived for about one year in my
              father's village, Alcañices. This is a small village,
              capital of the territory called Aliste, in the countryside
              of Spain, on the northeast border with Portugal. My
              mother's village, which is even smaller, is called <a
                href="https://www.aliste.info/es/pueblos/Sejas/">Sejas
                de Aliste</a>, and is the place where I used to spend my
              whole summer vacation when I was a teenager, visiting my
              grandfather, <i>el tí Rufino</i>, as he was known in the
              village. I really appreciate those days, not just for the
              fun and good times I had with some of my oldest friends,
              but for everything I learned about the small things, like
              working the land, and taking care of farm animals, since
              you do not deal with these things in the urban
              environment. </p>
            <p align="justify"> <a href="pics/yurre.jpg"> <img
                  src="pics/yurre_red.jpg" alt="Yurre, Vizcaya"

                  align="left"></a> After the first year in Zamora we
              moved to the <a href="https://www.euskadi.eus/inicio/">Basque

                Country</a>. This is an industrialized region located by
              the sea on the north coast of Spain. We lived in Yurre
              (Vizcaya), a small village with a population of about 3000
              people, for the rest of my childhood. You know, I attended
              primary school, played football, definitively not my
              speciallity, run through the woods looking for mysterious
              sites, and that kind of stuff. This was the ideal village
              for it. The village is located in the valley of Arratia,
              one of the inner and narrow valleys of Vizcaya, which
              makes the weather so humid. As time went by I learned to
              love that kind of weather, and now whenever there is a
              cloudy, humid, foggy day I am very happy. It reminds me
              the warmth of home. </p>

                  align="right"></a> When I was sixteen my family moved
              to <a href="https://www.amorebieta-etxano.eus/es/">Amorebieta</a>,
              a town ten kilometers away from Yurre, and twenty from <a
href="https://www.bilbao.eus/cs/Satellite?language=en&amp;pagename=Bilbaonet%2FPage%2FBIO_home">Bilbao</a>,
              and near other famous towns as Durango and Gernika.
              Amorebieta, in the valley of Ibaizabal, which means the
              valley of wide river (<i>ibai=river</i> and <i>zabal=wide</i>),

              as it comes from Euskera (Basque), ancient language of
              unknown origin spoken in the north of Spain and southwest
              of France, is a town of 20,000 people. I spent here my
              High School and College years. I can remember playing
              cards with my friends in between classes in High School
              (my friends cheated, of course) and the principal coming
              by and preaching us about it, how I was being spoiled and
              perverted by such bad friendship. She said: <i>``Esto
                parece el Far West, solo os faltan las pistolas''</i>
              (This is like the Far West, you just need for the guns).
              What a shame, too bad, too bad. I have to say that at the
              end all of us are doing well, no one finished in jail,
              although I could end up in Yale, but just if I kill
              somebody, eh Ivo? </p>

              in High School I went to Collage in the <a
                href="https://www.ehu.eus/en/en-home">Universidad del
                País Vasco</a>, very near home, not to disappoint the
              Spanish tradition of staying home until you are about
              forty (I do not understand how people do not feel ashamed
              about it).&nbsp; So, <span style="font-style: italic;">living</span>
              on campus, as a friend said: "<span style="font-style:
                italic;">it looks like we live here if it wasn't that we
                sleep at home</span>", I completed my major in Physics
              after five years of up-and-downs, like <i>la agoñía</i>
              in the dark side, or <i>el txoko</i>, or that visit to
              Lisbon during the last year, in the moments to be
              remembered, just a glimpse of what was about to come in
              the future, because it looks like the circle always closes
              upon itself. Finally, we, <i>the class of '94</i>,
              graduated on <i>San Fermín</i>'s Day, July 7th (<i>Viva
                San Fermín</i>, ¡aupa!).&nbsp; We even had a graduation
              ceremony, the first one, organized by the new Dean of the
              Faculty of Science, <span style="font-style: italic;">Manolo

                Tello</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">je, je,
                je, ¡qué bonito es ser joven!</span> (it is good to be
              young!), what a character!<br>
            </p>
            <p align="justify"> <a href="pics/geologia.jpg"> <img

                  hspace="5" vspace="0" align="right"></a>I don't know
              exactly why I studied Physics, because what I really
              wanted to do was Medicine and be useful to society. With
              all this in my mind I was offered the possibility of going
              to <a href="https://www.barcelona.cat/en/">Barcelona</a>
              (<a href="https://web.gencat.cat/en/inici/index.html">Catalonia</a>,
              Spain), to work in the Ph.D. program in the <a
                href="https://www.ub.edu/web/portal/en/">Universitat de
                Barcelona</a>. I accepted that offer because I was
              misled by the name of the title I would receive after my
              graduation: "<i>doctor</i>". Anyway, I graduated as a
              so-called <i>doctor</i> from the University of Barcelona
              four years and four days after I arrived in there, what a
              sentence! The experience was, let's say, interesting. It
              brought me back to my roots, and I graduated with a <i>txapela</i>
              (typical Basque cap), and a <i>botijo</i> (a clay
              container which keeps water cool). Sometimes, though, I
              regret not having used my bazooka. Yes, because I had a
              bazooka. It was a present from my friends, who could not
              stand seeing how much I suffered in the SUSY classes, so
              they decided to provide me with an instrument to release
              my tension. The biggest deception came when I was told
              after the graduation that I would not be able to prescribe
              pills despite my <i>title</i>. It would have been fun to
              decide which pill, the green, the yellow, the red, or the
              blue one, is more convenient for my patients from the look
              of their faces as they entered my office. </p>

              and in order to overcome such a big disappointment in my
              life I went to the <a href="https://www.illinois.edu/">University

                of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>, Illinois, USA.
              Champaign-Urbana, in the middle of the prairie, is a very
              good place for meditation, even a little bit depressing if
              you are not very forward, because there are very few
              people walking in the streets, despite, or because of, its
              two downtowns and the campustown. Although it is more
              dramatic in Thanksgiving or Spring Break, when this
              resembles very much a phantom city. Fortunately, in the
              following years we learned how to cook the Thanksgiving
              Turkey, and left on a Spring Break trip ourselves. This is
              a marvelous place if you enjoy Spring and Fall seasons,
              and I definitively am a Fall person. So, after a while you
              get used to living in such a quiet place, and you know
              good friends, which make it hard for you to accept you
              have to leave. However I left knowing that a small piece
              of my heart would remain here. After all, everything gives
              credit to the lyrics of the <a href="flatCU.html">Flat

              experience I came back just to leave again, much nearer
              this time, for Portugal.&nbsp; I almost cannot decide a
              place to talk about, since my six months there were a tour
              which took me to most of the cities: Évora, Medieval town
              with a wall and a Roman Temple dedicated to Diana,
              Coimbra, with the oldest university in Portugal and
              beautiful gardens and footpath along the river Mondego,
              which meets the ocean in Figueira da Foz, ah! impressive.
              Oporto, very nice people there, Lisbon, like a very large
              town, very cozy, Braga, so... Galician.&nbsp; It is
              incredible that despite the fact I am from a village five
              kilometers away from Portugal I had never visited it with
              such intensity.&nbsp; I have to grant all the honor to my
              hosts in the <a href="https://www.uevora.pt/en/">Universidade

                de Évora</a>, who were really nice to me and showed me
              around.&nbsp; They where even kind enough to allow me
              destroy Portuguese speaking what is know as Portuñol, a
              mixture of Portuguese and Spanish (Español).&nbsp; This is
              very nice, because I always wanted to know why people in
              my village had such strange expressions; and they are not
              strange, they are Portuguese.<br>

              in the <a href="https://www.csic.es/en">Consejo Superior
                de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC)</a>, where I was
              having fun squishing the computers to their maximum
              performance, or to my maximum performance to be
              accurate.&nbsp; Going to the <a
                href="https://www.uam.es/UAM/Home.htm?language=en">Universidad

                Autónoma de Madrid</a> campus, outside the city, was a
              relief, since the trees, grass fields and little birds
              take you away from the stress and traffic jams, and after
              all you can always stop by the center on your way home to
              meet your friends, watch a movie, go for a stroll to el
              Retiro... so many things to do, and so little time.&nbsp;
              But what I always had time for was for participating in
              the demonstrations against everything, mainly the
              government, because <span style="font-style: italic;">Spain

                is</span> not <span style="font-style: italic;">doing
                well</span>, and this is really fun and relaxing,
              believe me, I am almost a professional now.&nbsp; One more
              thing about Madrid is that it is not far from anywhere in
              Spain, and I could go home whenever I felt like having
              mom's meals, and she is very happy to have me there
              anyway, so it is great!<br>

              large cities are not for me, so I decided to move again,
              this time to Zaragoza.&nbsp; This is a nice place, and if
              you get there during Pilar's holidays you will want to
              repeat again and again.&nbsp; I registered at the <a
                href="https://www.unizar.es/information-institution/name-and-address">Universidad

                de Zaragoza</a> for an <a
                href="https://master.eurec.be/">European Master in
                Renewable Energy</a>, where I met many enthusiastic
              people wanting to make of this a much better world, <span
                style="font-style: italic;">let's see if we can get it!</span>
              Since it is an European Master after three months I moved
              to the <a href="https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/">Northumbria

                University</a> at <a
                href="https://www.newcastlegateshead.com/">Newcastle
                upon Tyne</a> in England for my specialization in
              Photovoltaic Solar Systems (<span style="font-style:
                italic;">I'm gonna soak up the sun..</span>. Sheryl Crow
              says).&nbsp; I always liked&nbsp; Newcastle Brown Ale, so
              this is the place to be; you can get it here in very large
              bottles, draft and I bet you can even buy a
              barrel.&nbsp;&nbsp; And this city reminds me a lot of
              Bilbao.&nbsp; So, perhaps I am just feeling nostalgic and
              that is the reason I like places like this; and Spring is
              comming.<br style="font-style: italic;">

            <p align="justify">This is a short version of my life. There
              are so many people out there who deny themselves the right
              to understand the world as a whole, and concentrate just
              on what they think are the <i>important</i> problems,
              that we will be in trouble if we allow them to rule our
              lifes. Sometimes I have been asked for the place I
              consider as <i>home</i>. Of course, there exist such a
              place where you feel comfortable and protected whenever
              you go. However, should we not love every place we visit,
              and learn to integrate all the experiences we get there to
              improve our lifes and make the world a better place to
              live? </p>
            And as for what I deserve or do not deserve let's talk about
            it any other time. </td>
